# Enhanced Keyboard Remote

An AppDaemon app that **enhances** the functionality of the Home Assistant [Keyboard Remote](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/keyboard_remote) integration by adding the following features:

- Maps key codes to your own logical name for that key. So instead of referring to a key as (for example) `110` in your automations and scripts, you could refer to it as `play`.
- Adds support for long press versions of every key, effectively doubling the number of keys on your remote/keyboard.

A great use case for this app is utilizating a USB RF remote control as a universal remote.
